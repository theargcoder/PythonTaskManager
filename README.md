# PythonTaskManager
This is my intro to Python, its a school project :/ first time ever using python hopefully last time too.

## About
PythonTaskManager is a command line interface that will be able to serve as a Task Manger for your daily-weekly-montly-yearly-etc tasks.
Will write to a file all the tasks for persistency and be able to add and remove tasks dynamically.
